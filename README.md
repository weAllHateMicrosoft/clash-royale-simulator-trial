# Clash Royale Simulator 

Finally! A Clash Royale bot training environment that's playable, actively maintained and has a RL interface.

I like clash royale and want to train a RL agent to play the game. 
However, a simulator is needed to speed up training. I searched on GitHub and the only usable project I found
was samdickson22's [repository](https://github.com/samdickson22/clash-simulator). I noticed that the code is almost completely written by AI, which is hard to read and impossible for humans to make improvements on the code.

In the end, I realized that the only way to make all of this work is to re-implement the whole game from scratch, without any vibe-coding.

Now, I present this functioning simulator that implemented 47 cards including troops,
buildings and spells (complete list below) and can reach the simulation speed of 83 microseconds per tick.
This means that the simulator can play more than 1000 games (with itself) within an hour.

I also designed a RL training environment compatible with gymnasium and stable-baselines3, supporting out-of-the-box training.
I used a PPO algorithm to train a basic model for 3M timesteps and can reach a winrate of 83% against a non-trained version of the agent.

To quickly know more information about my project, see [my paper](ClashSimPaper.pdf).

## Game Interface

## Installation

Run the following command in your terminal to clone this repository and install the required python packages.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jason-XII/clash-royale-simulator.git
cd clash-royale-simulator
pip install pygame fastcore numpy==1.26.4 stable-baselines3 tensorboard --user --no-cache-dir
```

## How to play

This simulator is already playable! You need two computers that connect to the same local network. 

1. Run `ipconfig` on Windows or `ifconfig | grep inet` on macOS. Find your ip address in the local network. 
If you are at home, the address should look like 192.168.xx.xx, if you are connected to a school network, 
then that will probably start with a 10.xx.xx.xx.

2. Modify the parameter in `server.py` in `src/clasher_new` and run it. Code files all live in this directory. 
3. Send the `client_side` folder to another device and run the `client.py`. 
4. Follow the instructions in the GUI and enter the server ip address after choosing your deck.
5. When two clients are connected to the same server, the game starts automatically! 
You can see elixir, drag and drop to deploy cards, see entities on the screen, etc.


## Supported features

I have implemented 47 cards in total, no evolutions, hero or champion cards are
implemented yet. The simulator's behavior is not *completely* consistent with real gameplay
and I'm continuously trying to improve this. For example, the path finding algorithm 
uses a non-search approach, which is faster but makes the characters slightly slower 
when walking. This might be solved in the future though.

Complete list of implemented cards:

- Knight
- Giant
- Archers
- Goblins
- Pekka
- MiniPekka
- Minions
- Skeletons
- SkeletonArmy
- Balloon
- Witch
- Barbarians
- Golem
- Valkyrie
- Bomber
- Musketeer
- BabyDragon
- Prince
- Wizard
- SpearGoblins
- GiantSkeleton
- HogRider
- MinionHorde
- RoyalGiant
- Princess
- ThreeMusketeers (Not the newest version though)
- BlowdartGoblin (Before nerf)
- AngryBarbarians (English name: Elite Barbarians)
- Bats
- DartBarrell (English name: Flying Machine)
- RoyalHogs
- Cannon
- Xbow
- IceWizard
- SkeletonWarriors
- DarkPrince
- LavaHound
- IceSpirits
- FireSpirits
- Miner
- Sparky
- Bowler
- Rage
- RageBarbarian (English name: Lumberjack)
- BattleRam
- Fireball
- Arrows

## Read the code

If you are interested in this project, you can consider reading my code and figure out
how the simulator work for yourself. I tried my best to write clear code. Here's a brief
explanation of each python file in the repo, listed in suggested reading order:

The real code files are in `src/clasher_new`. 
- `__init__.py` is an empty placeholder
- `gamedata.json` contains very necessary data extracted from the game, like hitpoints, damage, etc.
- `cards_stats_xxx.json` files are also game data files downloaded from *royaleapi.com*.
- `card_utils.py` reads `gamedata.json` and provides easy ways to access character attributes
- `arena.py` defines `TileGrid` which contains information on where each sides' King tower and princess towers are located
- `player.py` is a short file that stores a player's information in game, like current elixir.
- `battle.py` contains all the game logic, defining behavior for troops, buildings, projectiles and other mechanics.
- `core.py` and `card_mechanics.py` provides an interface for special card logic. Makes the system more flexible.
- `server.py` and `client.py` gives a simple pygame interface that allows two players to connect through local network and play in realtime.

## To-do list

I trained the model for 8M steps and the win rate stops improving at around 70-80%. This is probably
caused by the model trying to independently predict the card, position x and position y.
Humans make decisions by choosing all three simultaneously, we first determine (vaguely)
what we should do, and then do the actual placement. So I think the model can perform better
if I let it produce the x and y position at once, or we use a different structure entirely
by using the selection attention framework introduced in another paper. I might have to 
learn more about that paper. 

Against a random agent, the PPO model should train relatively well and be consistently winning
after 1-2M steps. So something's probably wrong with the model architecture.

I also thought of a way to determine the level of game playing agents: tier testing.
Imagine we have a pool of agents and we let them fight for enough rounds. Good enough agents will 
consistently win and those with winrates over 70% can make it to the next tier. The logic 
might be a little flawed here but points to the right direction.

(might introduce elo score?)

Lots of new benchmarks can be added besides the winrate against a random agent. For example,
we can test the agent's use of spells by placing swarm units at the bridge. By placing a
mini pekka behind a giant we test the agent's ability of defending. 

The environment can also be refined. The agent needs to know the phase of the game that 
it's currently in, because decks have different strategies in single, double and triple elixir.
When it's near the end of the game and overtime, the agent may need to cycle spells to win.

The biggest flaw in the simulator is that the king tower activation seems a bit off. 
The king tower seems to have a shorter range than the musketeer, which is very strange.
But this can be easily fixed.
